                Imagine closing each workday with a satisfied sigh, knowing that you had been so productive that you accomplished everything on your list. And knowing, too, that you were at the top of your creative gameâ€”getting your tasks done both efficiently and well. See yourself whistling as you walk away from work?

            <br>The Community</h1> 
            <p>
                Every day, there are people around you who may be going through difficult times without you even knowing it. Their problems could be financial, physical, or psychological. In fact, loneliness is a growing issue that is often difficult to detect. By taking some time to get to know your neighbors, you can find out more about the challenges they face and develop ways to help them. Whether the solution is planning a budget, doing some grocery shopping, or even having a brief chat, a little effort can make a large difference in their lives.

                Everyday we have some routine tasks. We need breaks to do the routine task like taking breakfast, praying, taking dinner etc. If leave the work for a simple 15 munites task, it takes anyhow more than half an hour. In 2022 I will try to reduce it by applying appropiate techniques. I will read some books and article to do it efficiently. Everyday we have some routine tasks.
